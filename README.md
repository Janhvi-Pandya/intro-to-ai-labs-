# Intro to Artificial Intelligence — Applied Labs

This repository contains a curated set of **applied AI labs** completed as part of an *Intro to Artificial Intelligence* course.  
The labs focus on **problem-solving, algorithmic reasoning, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning**, with an emphasis on **analysis, evaluation, and practical implementation in Python**.

Each notebook demonstrates a different AI paradigm, progressing from classical search to learning-based methods.

## Notes for Reviewers

- Each lab is **self-contained** and includes explanations, analysis, and results.
- The progression reflects a transition from **symbolic AI → probabilistic reasoning → machine learning**.
- These notebooks are intended to demonstrate **applied understanding**, not just theoretical knowledge.
